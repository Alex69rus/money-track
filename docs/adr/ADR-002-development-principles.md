# ADR-002: Development Principles

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish development principles for the MVP that prioritize speed, simplicity, and rapid iteration while avoiding over-engineering.

## Decision
We will follow these core principles:
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simplest solution that works
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't build features until needed
- **MVP First**: Build minimal viable features, iterate based on feedback
- **No Premature Optimization**: Optimize only when needed
- **Convention over Configuration**: Use framework defaults where possible
- **Fail Fast**: Quick feedback loops, early error detection

Development practices:
- **Git Flow**: Simple main branch + feature branches
- **Testing**: Unit tests only for critical business logic
- **Code Style**: Follow framework conventions (.NET conventions, Prettier for React)
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic only, README for setup

## Rationale
- KISS and YAGNI prevent feature bloat and over-engineering
- MVP approach allows for quick validation of core concept
- Framework conventions reduce decision paralysis
- Minimal testing strategy focuses on business-critical code
- Simple git workflow reduces overhead

## Consequences
- Faster initial development
- Less technical debt from unused features
- Focus on core functionality first
- May need refactoring as requirements evolve
- Reduced complexity in codebase
