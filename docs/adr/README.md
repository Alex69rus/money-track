## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help document the "why" behind technical decisions for future reference.

Each ADR follows a standard format:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Consequences**: What are the positive and negative impacts
