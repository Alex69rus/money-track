Create a file docs/workflow.md with the rules for performing work on the tasklist @tasklist.md,
to instruct the code assistant on the development of our application on @vision.md

Important:
- perform work strictly according to the plan
- before each iteration, first agree on the proposed solution with code segments
- after agreement, implement
- then wait for confirmation
- update the progress in the tasklist
- mark completed tasks
- agree on the transition to the next iteration
- make a commit to the repository

The workflow should be concise, contain only the main thing and follow the KISS principle
