Create a step-by-step iterative development plan: docs/tasklist.md

Each step should allow you to test the application.
Each iteration adds new functionality.

At the top, set aside space for a progress report that will be updated after each iteration.
A beautiful report in a table, with statuses, icons.

Each task should be marked with a checkbox for visual progress tracking
The plan should also be concise, contain only the main thing and follow the KISS principle
