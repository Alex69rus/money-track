Let's create vision.md file
There we will put vision of the project @idea.md:
- Technologies
- Development Principles
- Project Structure
- Project Architecture
- Data Model
- LLM Integration
- LLM Monitoring
- Usage Scenarios
- Deployment
- Configuration Approach
- Logging Approach

This document will serve as our starting point and technical design for subsequent development.

Let's create sequentially.
Analyze the composition of the document.
Go sequentially through the sections.
Ask me questions, offer a final vision, and after agreeing with me, record it in the document.
Then move on to the next section.

The most important thing:
We need to create the simplest possible solution to test our idea, according to the KISS principles.
No overengineering.
Only the most necessary and simple in all sections!
