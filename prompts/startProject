I'm going to implement a Telegram bot and a Telegram web app. 

This application will allow users to send sms from the bank, which will be parsed by a Telegram bot and saved to the database. 
The Telegram web app (accessible through this Telegram bot) will display transactions, analytics for the user's transactions, and provide CRUD functionality for managing their transactions. 
Also, the Telegram web app will have a dedicated screen for AI Chat: "Talk to your money," which will answer questions about users' transactions. 

Already made decisions:
- n8n workflows for implementing a Telegram bot, which will parse sms and answer questions about the user's money.
- react for the front-end of the Telegram web app
- database: postgres
- containerization: docker
